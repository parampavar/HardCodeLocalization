HardCodeLocalization
====================

This is a fork of the one with the same name found in sourceforge.net http://sourceforge.net/projects/hcl/. 

The above mentioned project seems to be abandoned. Hence I am trying to resurect it here. The full credit for the idea and concept goes to the owner of the above mentioned project.

I will try to extend this as much as possible.

Description
-----------
Python scripts that help you pull out hardcoded strings from your source codes and represent them as a .csv table. You can then write localized versions of those strings and put them back into your code.

Currently supports: .php, .js, .html, .sql
